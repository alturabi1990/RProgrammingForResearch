## Templates

R Markdown **templates** can be used to change multiple elements of the style of a rendered document. You can think of these as being the document-level analog to the themes we've used with `ggplot` objects. \bigskip

To do this, some kind of style file is applied when rendering document. For HTML documents, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) (`.css`) can be used to change the style of different elements. For pdf files, LaTeX package (style) files (`.sty`) are used.

## Templates

To open a new R Markdown file that uses a template, in RStudio, go to "File" -> "New File" -> "R Markdown" -> "From Template".

Different templates come with different R packages. A couple of templates come with the `rmarkdown` package, which you likely already have.

## Templates

Many of these templates will only render to pdf. \bigskip

To render a pdf from R Markdown, you need to have a version of TeX installed on your computer. Like R, TeX is open source software. RStudio recommends the following installations by system:

- For Macs: MacTeX
- For PCs: MiKTeX

Links for installing both can be found at http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html \bigskip

Current version of TeX: 3.14159265.

## Templates

The `tufte` package has templates for creating handouts typeset like Edward Tufte's books. \bigskip

This package includes templates for creating both pdf and HTML documents in this style. \bigskip

The package includes special functions like `newthought`, special chunk options like `fig.fullwidth`, and special knitr engines like `marginfigure`. Special features available in the tufte template include:

- Margin references
- Margin figures
- Side notes
- Full width figures

## Templates

The `rticles` package has templates for several journals:

- *Journal of Statistical Software*
- *The R Journal*
- *Association for Computing Machinery*
- ACS publications (*Journal of the American Chemical Society*, *Environmental Science & Technology*)
- Elsevier publications

## Templates

Some of these templates create a whole directory, with several files besides the .Rmd file. For example, the template for *The R Journal* includes:

- The R Markdown file in which you write your article
- "RJournal.sty": A LaTeX package (style) file specific to *The R Journal*. This file tells LaTeX how to render all the elements in your article in the style desired by this journal.
- "RJreferences.bib": A BibTeX file, where you can save citation information for all references in your article.
- "Rlogo.png": An example figure (the R logo).

## Templates

Once you render the R Markdown document from this template, you'll end up with some new files in the directory:

- "[your file name].tex": A TeX file with the content from your R Markdown file. This will be "wrapped" with some additional formatting input to create "RJwrapper.tex".
- "RJwrapper.tex": A TeX file that includes both the content from your R Markdown file and additional formatting input. Typically, you will submit this file (along with the BibTeX, any figure and image files, and possibly the style file) to the journal.
- "RJwrapper.pdf": The rendered pdf file (what the published article would look like)

## Templates

This template files will often require some syntax that looks more like LaTeX than Markdown. \bigskip

For example, for the template for *The R Journal*, you need to use `\citep{}` and `\citet{}` to include citations. These details will depend on the style file of the template. \bigskip

As a note, you can always use raw LaTeX in R Markdown documents, not just in documents you're creating with a template. You just need to be careful not to mix the two. For example, if you use a LaTeX environment to begin an itemized list (e.g., with `begin{itemize}`), you must start each item with `item`, not `-`.

## Templates

You can create your own template. You create it as part of a custom R package, and then will have access to the template once you've installed the package. This can be useful if you often write documents in a certain style, or if you ever work somewhere with certain formatting requirements for reports. \bigskip
