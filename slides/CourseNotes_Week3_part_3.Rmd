# Factors in R

## Factors in R

Factor vectors are used in R for **categorical variables**, where more than 
one observation can have the same category.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="4.5in"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/how_r_stores_figures.jpg")
```

Factor variables have one or more **levels**. While you will always see a 
factor printed with its factor level labels, R "remembers" the variable
with each level assigned a number.

## Factors in R

In tibbles, factors will be noted with "fctr" under the column name. 
For example, look at the `aqi` column in the `beijing_pm` data:

```{r}
head(beijing_pm, n = 3)
```

## Factors in R

You can use the `levels` function to see the levels of a factor vector, as well
as the order those levels are recorded in R.

```{r}
levels(beijing_pm$aqi)
```

## Factors in R

To explore a factor vector, you'll often want to **count** the number of 
observations in each category. You can do that with two functions in the
`dplyr` package, `group_by` and `count`. 

Start with a dataframe that includes the factor variable as a column. 
First `group_by` the factor, then pipe the output of that into the `count`
function. 

This will create a new summary dataframe, with a row for each level of the
factor. A column called `n` will give the number of observations in the 
original data that had that level of the factor.

## Factors in R

You can **count** how many observations have each level of a factor.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="4.5in"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/counting_factor.jpg")
```

## Factors in R

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
beijing_pm %>% 
  group_by(aqi) %>% 
  count()
```

## Factors in R

You can jointly explore multiple columns in a dataframe. 

For example, if one column is a factor and one is numeric, it can be
useful to explore values of the numeric column within each level of 
the factor column. 

For the Beijing data, you may want to find out the mean comcentration of
PM\textsubscript{2.5} within each AQI level.

## Factors in R

You can **summarize** a numeric column within levels of a factor column:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="4in", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/factor_summarize.jpg")
```

## Factors in R

To do this, pipe the dataframe into `group_by` (where you can group by the
factor column) and then into `summarize`, where you can calculate summaries. 

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
beijing_pm %>% 
  group_by(aqi) %>% 
  summarize(mean_pm = mean(value))
```


## Factors in R

You can create several summaries at once: 

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
beijing_pm %>% 
  group_by(aqi) %>% 
  summarize(min_pm = min(value), 
            max_pm = max(value))
```

## Factors in R

As a note, there's a function called `n()` that you can use inside
summarize to replace `count`. For example, these two expressions
give the same output: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
beijing_pm %>% 
  group_by(aqi) %>% 
  count()

beijing_pm %>% 
  group_by(aqi) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
```

## Factors in R

If a column is in a character class, but you'd like it to be a 
factor, you can use `as_factor` from the `forcats` package: 

```{r}
library("forcats")
beijing_pm %>% 
  mutate(qc = as_factor(qc))
```
