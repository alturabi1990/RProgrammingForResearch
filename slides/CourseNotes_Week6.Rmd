# Tidy data

## Tidy data

All of the material in this section comes directly from Hadley Wickham's [paper
on tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). You will need to read
this paper to prepare for the quiz on this section.

## Characteristics of tidy data

Characteristics of tidy data are:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Getting your data into a "tidy" format makes it easier to model and plot. By
taking the time to tidy your data at the start of an analysis, you will save
yourself time, and make it easier to plan out, later steps.

## Five common problems

Here are five common problems that Hadley Wickham has identified that keep data
from being tidy:

1. Column headers are values, not variable names.
2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.
3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

In the following slides, I'll give examples of each of these problems.

## Five common problems

(1.) Column headers are values, not variable names.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataProblem1.png")
```

## Five common problems

Solution: 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.6\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataSolution1.png")
```

## Five common problems

(2.) Multiple variables are stored in one column.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.4\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataProblem2.png")
```

## Five common problems

Solution: 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.4\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataSolution2.png")
```

## Five common problems

(3.) Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataProblem3.png")
```

## Five common problems

Solution: 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataSolution3.png")
```

## Five common problems

(4.) Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataProblem4.png")
```

## Five common problems

Solution: 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataSolution4.png")
```

## Five common problems

(5.) A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. \bigskip

Example: exposure and outcome data stored in different files: 

- File 1: Daily mortality counts
- File 2: Daily air pollution measurements

## In-course exercise

We'll take a break now to do the In-Course Exercise (Section 1 of the In-course Exercise for Chapter 6).


# Joining datasets

## Joining datasets

So far, you have only worked with a single data source at a time. When you work
on your own projects, however, you typically will need to merge together two or
more datasets to create the a data frame to answer your research question.
\bigskip

For example, for air pollution epidemiology, you will often have to join several
datasets:

- Health outcome data (e.g., number of deaths per day)
- Air pollution concentrations
- Weather measurements (since weather can be a confounder)
- Demographic data

## `*_join` functions

The `dplyr` package has a family of different functions to join two dataframes
together, the `*_join` family of functions. These include: 

- `inner_join`
- `full_join`
- `left_join`
- `right_join`

All combine two dataframes, which I'll call `course_grades` and `course_days`
here.

<!-- The functions include: -->

<!-- - `inner_join(course_grades, course_days)`: Keep only rows where there are -->
<!-- observations in both `course_grades` and `course_days`. -->
<!-- - `left_join(course_grades, course_days)`: Keep all rows from `course_grades`, -->
<!-- whether they have a match in `course_days` or not. -->
<!-- - `right_join(course_grades, course_days)`: Keep all rows from `course_days`, -->
<!-- whether they have a match in `course_grades` or not. -->
<!-- - `full_join(course_grades, course_days)`: Keep all rows from both -->
<!-- `course_grades` and `course_days`, whether they have a match in the other -->
<!-- dataset or not. -->

## `*_join` functions

```{r, out.width = "\\textwidth", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/join_functions.jpg")
```

## `inner_join`

```{r, out.width = "\\textwidth", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/inner_join.jpg")
```

## `full_join`

```{r, out.width = "\\textwidth", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/full_join.jpg")
```

## `left_join`

```{r, out.width = "\\textwidth", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/left_join.jpg")
```

## `right_join`

```{r, out.width = "\\textwidth", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/right_join.jpg")
```

## `*_join` functions

For some more complex examples of using join, I'll use these example datasets (`x` and `y`):

```{r echo = FALSE}
x <- tibble(course = c("x", "x", "y", "z"),
                grade = c(92, 90, 82, 78),
                student = c("a", "b", "a", "b"))
y <- tibble(class = c("w", "x", "x", "y"),
                day = c("Tues", "Mon / Fri", "Mon / Fri", "Tue"), 
                student = c("a", "a", "b", "a"))
x
y
```

## `*_join` functions

If you have two datasets you want to join, but the column names for the joining column are different, you can use the `by` argument: 

```{r}
full_join(x, y, by = list(x = "course", y = "class"))
```

## `*_join` functions

A few things to note about this example: 

- The joining column name for the "left" dataframe (`x` in this case) is used as the column name for the joined data
- `student` was a column name in both `x` and `y`. If we're not using it to join the data, the column names are changed in the joined data to `student.x` and `student.y`.
- Values are recycled for rows where there were multiple matches across the dataframe (e.g., rows for course "x")

## `*_join` functions

Sometimes, you will want to join by more than one column. In this example data, it would make sense to join the data by matching both course and student. You can do this by using a vector of all columns to join on: 

```{r}
full_join(x, y, by = list(x = c("course", "student"),
                          y = c("class", "student")))
```

## In-course exercise

We'll take a break now to do the In-Course Exercise (Section 2 of the In-course Exercise for Chapter 6).

# Longer and wider data

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

There are two functions from the `tidyr` package (another member of the
tidyverse) that you can use to change between wide and long data: `pivot_longer`
and `pivot_wider`. \bigskip

These are brand new, and they replace the older `gather` and `spread` functions. 
To use the new functions, you many need to install the development version
of the `tidyr` package. You can do that with: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

Here is a description of these two functions:

- `pivot_longer`: Takes several columns and pivots them down into two columns. One of the new columns contains the former column names and the other contains the former cell values.
- `pivot_wider`: Takes two columns and pivots them up into multiple columns. Column names for the new columns will come from one column and the cell values from the other.

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

```{r out.width = "\\textwidth", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/pivot_functions.jpg")
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

The following examples show the effects of making a dataset longer or wider.
\bigskip

Here is some example wide data:

```{r, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
hogwarts_wide <- tibble(
  student = c("Harry", "Hermione"),
  math = c(89, 100),
  english = c(92, 99), 
  science = c(93, 98)
)
```

```{r}
hogwarts_wide
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

In the `hogwarts_wide` dataset, there are separate columns for three different
courses (`math`, `english`, and `science`). Each cell gives the value for a
certain stock on a certain day. 


```{r}
hogwarts_wide
```

This data isn't "tidy", because the identify of the course (`math`, `english`,
or `science`) is a variable, and you'll probably want to include it as a
variable in modeling.

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

If you want to convert the dataframe to have all stock values in a single column, you can use `pivot_longer` to convert wide data to long data: 

```{r}
library("tidyr")
hogwarts_long <- pivot_longer(data = hogwarts_wide,
                              cols = math:science,
                              names_to = "subject",
                              values_to = "grade")
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

In this "longer" dataframe, there is now one column that gives the identify of
the course (`subject`) and another column that gives the grade a student got 
for that course (`grade`):

```{r}
hogwarts_long
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

The format for a `pivots_longer` call is: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Generic code
new_df <- pivot_longer(old_df,
                       cols = [name(s) of the columns you want 
                               to make longer],
                       names_to = [name of new column to store 
                                   the old column names],
                       values_to = [name of new column to store 
                                    the old values])
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

Three important notes:

- Everything is pivoted into one of two columns---one column with the old
column names, and one column with the old cell values
- With the `names_to` and `values_to` arguments, you are just providing column
names for the two columns that everything's pivoted into. When you are pivoting
from "wide" to "long", you get to pick these names.
- If there is a column you don't want to include in the pivot (`date` in the
example), use `-` to exclude it in the `cols` argument.

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

Notice how easy it is, now that the data is gathered, to use `subject` for
aesthetics of faceting in a `ggplot2` call:

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(hogwarts_long, aes(x = student, y = grade)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~ subject) +
  theme_bw()
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

If you have data in a "longer" format and would like to make it "wider", you can
use `pivot_wider` to do that:

```{r}
hogwarts <- pivot_wider(hogwarts_long, 
                        names_from = "subject", 
                        values_from = "grade")
```

Notice that this reverses the action of `pivot_longer`.

## Further reading

Chapters 12 and 13 of "R for Data Science" are an excellent supplemental
resource if you'd like extra practice on tidy data, pivoting, and joining
different datasets.

**Note:** At this time "R for Data Science" uses the `gather` and `spread`
instead of `pivot_*`. These are older functions, you should use `pivot_*`.

# More with `dplyr`

## `dplyr`

So far, you've used several `dplyr` functions: 

- `rename`
- `filter`
- `select`
- `mutate`
- `group_by`
- `summarize`

Some other useful `dplyr` functions to add to your toolbox are: 

- `separate` and `unite`
- `mutate` and other `dplyr` functions with `group_by`
- `anti_join` and `semi_join`

## `separate`

Sometimes, you want to take one column and split it into two columns. For example, you may have information for two variables in one column: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
ebola <- tibble(ebola_key = c("Liberia_Cases", "Liberia_Deaths", 
                              "Spain_Cases", "Spain_Deaths"))
```

```{r}
ebola
```


## `separate`

If you have a consistent "split" character, you can use the `separate` function to split one column into two: 

```{r}
ebola %>%
  separate(col = ebola_key, into = c("country", "outcome"),
           sep = "_")
```

## `separate`

Here is the generic code for `separate`: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Generic code
separate([dataframe], 
         col = [name of the single column you want to split],
         into = [vector of the names of the columns 
                 you want to create],
         sep = [the character that designates where 
                you want to split])
```

## `separate`

The default is to drop the original column and only keep the columns into which it was split. However, you can use the argument `remove = FALSE` to keep the first column, as well: 

```{r}
ebola %>%
  separate(col = ebola_key, into = c("country", "outcome"),
           sep = "_", remove = FALSE)
```

## `separate`

You can use the `fill` argument (`fill = "right"` or `fill = "left"`) to control what happens when there are some observations that do not have the split character. \bigskip

For example, say your original column looked like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
ebola <- tibble(ebola_key = c("Liberia_Cases", "Liberia", 
                              "Spain_Cases", "Spain_Deaths"))
ebola
```

## `separate`

You can use `fill = "right"` to set how to split observations like the second one, where there is no separator character ("_"):

```{r}
ebola %>%
  separate(col = ebola_key, into = c("country", "outcome"),
           sep = "_", fill = "right")
```

## In-course exercise

We'll take a break now to do the In-Course Exercise (Section 3 of the In-course Exercise for Chapter 6).

## `unite`

The `unite` function does the reverse of the `separate` function: it lets you join several columns into a single column. For example, say you have data where year, month, and day are split into different columns: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
date_example <- tibble(year = 2016, month = 10, day = 1:4)
date_example
```

## `unite`

You can use `unite` to join these into a single column: 

```{r}
date_example %>%
  unite(col = date, year, month, day, sep = "-")
```

## `unite`

If the columns you want to unite are in a row (and in the right order), you can use the `:` syntax with `unite`: 

```{r}
date_example %>%
  unite(col = date, year:day, sep = "-")
```

## Grouping with `mutate` versus `summarize`

So far, we have never used `mutate` with grouping. \bigskip

You can use `mutate` after grouping-- unlike `summarize`, the data will not be collapsed to fewer columns, but the summaries created by `mutate` will be added within each group. \bigskip

For example, if you wanted to add the mean time by team to the `worldcup` dataset, you could do that with `group_by` and `mutate` (see next slide).

## Grouping with `mutate` versus `summarize`

```{r}
worldcup %>%
  group_by(Position) %>%
  mutate(mean_time = mean(Time)) %>%
  slice(1:2) %>% select(Team:Time, mean_time)
```

<!-- ## More on `mutate`  -->

<!-- There are also some special functions that work well with `mutate`:  -->

<!-- - `lead`: Measured value for following observation -->
<!-- - `lag`: Measured value for previous observation -->
<!-- - `cumsum`: Sum of all values up to this point -->
<!-- - `cummax`: Highest value up to this point -->
<!-- - `cumany`: For TRUE / FALSE, have any been TRUE up to this point -->

<!-- ## More on `mutate`  -->

<!-- Here is an example of using `lead` and `lag` with mutate: -->

<!-- ```{r message = FALSE} -->
<!-- library(lubridate) -->
<!-- date_example %>%  -->
<!--   unite(col = date, year:day, sep = "-") %>% -->
<!--   mutate(date = ymd(date), -->
<!--          yesterday = lag(date), -->
<!--          tomorrow = lead(date)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## `slice`

You can also group by a factor first using `group_by`. Then, when you use `slice`, you will get the first few rows for each level of the group.  

```{r}
worldcup %>% 
  group_by(Position) %>% 
  slice(1:2)
```

## `arrange` with `group_by`

You can also group by a factor before arranging. In this case, all data for the first level of the factor will show up first, in the order given in `arrange`, then all data from the second level will show up in the specified order, etc.

```{r}
worldcup %>% 
  group_by(Team) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Saves)) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  head(n = 4)
```

## `semi_join` and `anti_join`

There are two more `*_join` functions we'll look at.

These functions allow you to filter one dataframe on only values that **do** have a match in a second dataframe (`semi_join`) or **do not** have a match in a second dataframe (`anti_join`).

These functions do **not** bring in columns from the second dataset. Instead, 
they check the second dataset to decide whether or not to keep certain rows 
in the first dataset.

## `semi_join`

```{r out.width = "0.98\\textwidth", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/semi_join.jpg")
```

The `semi_join` function filters to observations that **do**
have a match in a second dataframe.

## `anti_join`

```{r out.width = "0.98\\textwidth", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/anti_join.jpg")
```

The `anti_join` function filters to observations that **do not**
have a match in a second dataframe.

## In-course exercise

We'll take a break now to do the In-Course Exercise (Section 4 of the In-course
Exercise for Chapter 6).

# Tidying with `dplyr` 

## `VADeaths` data

For this example, I'll use the `VADeaths` dataset that comes with R. \bigskip

This dataset gives the death rates per 1,000 people in Virginia in 1940. It gives death rates by age, gender, and rural / urban:

```{r}
data("VADeaths")
VADeaths
```

## `VADeaths` data

There are a few things that make this data untidy: 

- One variable (age category) is saved as row names, rather than a column.
- Other variables (gender, rural / urban) are in column names.
- Once you gather the data, you will have two variables (gender, rural / urban) in the same column.

In the following slides, we'll walk through how to tidy this data. 

## Tidying the `VADeaths` data

(1) One variable (age category) is saved as row names, rather than a column. \bigskip

To fix this, we need to convert the row names into a new column. We can do this using `mutate` (load `tibble` if needed):

```{r echo = 2:4}
library(tibble)
VADeaths %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% ## Convert from matrix to dataframe
  rownames_to_column(var = "age")
```

## Tidying the `VADeaths` data

(2) Two variables (gender, rural / urban) are in column names. \bigskip

Gather the data to convert column names to a new column:

```{r}
VADeaths %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "age") %>%
  pivot_longer(- age, names_to = "gender_loc", values_to = "mort_rate") %>%
  slice(1:4)
```

## Tidying the `VADeaths` data

(3) Two variables (gender, rural / urban) in the same column. \bigskip

Separate the column into two separate columns for "gender" and "loc" (rural / urban):

```{r}
VADeaths %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "age") %>%
  pivot_longer(- age, names_to = "gender_loc", values_to = "mort_rate") %>%
  separate(col = gender_loc, into = c("gender", "loc"),
           sep = " ") %>%
  slice(1)
```

## Tidying the `VADeaths` data

Now that the data is tidy, it's much easier to plot: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
VADeaths <- VADeaths %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "age") %>%
  pivot_longer(- age, names_to = "gender_loc", values_to = "mort_rate") %>%
  separate(col = gender_loc, into = c("loc", "gender"),
           sep = " ")
```

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(VADeaths, aes(x = age, y = mort_rate,
                     color = gender)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap( ~ loc, ncol = 2) + 
  xlab("Age category") + ylab("Death rate (per 1,000)") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

# Working with factors

## Working with factors

Hadley Wickham has developed a package called `forcats` that helps you work with
factors.

```{r}
library("forcats")
```

## Factors

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/what_are_factors.jpg")
```

## `fct_recode`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/fct_recode.jpg")
```

## `fct_recode`

The `fct_recode` function can be used to change the labels of a function (along
the lines of using `factor` with `levels` and `labels` to reset factor labels).
\bigskip

One big advantage is that `fct_recode` lets you change labels for some, but not all, levels. For example, here are the team names:
\footnotesize
```{r}
worldcup %>% 
  filter(Team == "USA") %>%
  slice(1:3) %>% select(Team, Position, Time)
```

## `fct_recode`

If you just want to change "USA" to "United States", you can run: 

```{r}
worldcup <- worldcup %>%
  mutate(Team = fct_recode(Team, `United States` = "USA"))
worldcup %>%
  filter(Team == "United States") %>%
  slice(1:3) %>% select(Team, Position, Time)
```

## `fct_infreq`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/fct_infreq.jpg")
```

## `fct_infreq`

You can use the `fct_infreq` function to reorder the levels of a factor from most common to least common:

```{r}
levels(worldcup$Position)
worldcup <- worldcup %>%
  mutate(Position = fct_infreq(Position))
levels(worldcup$Position)
```

## `fct_reorder`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/fct_reorder.jpg")
```

## `fct_reorder`

If you want to reorder one factor by another variable (ascending order), you can use `fct_reorder` (e.g., homework 3). For example, to re-level `Position` by the median shots on goals for each position, you can run:

```{r}
levels(worldcup$Position)
worldcup <- worldcup %>%
  mutate(Position = fct_reorder(Position, Shots))
levels(worldcup$Position)
```

## `fct_lump`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.8\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/fct_lump.jpg")
```

## `fct_lump`

You can use the `fct_lump` function to lump uncommon factors into an "Other" category. For example, to lump the two least common positions together, you can run (`n` specifies how many categories to keep outside of "Other"): 

```{r}
worldcup %>%
  mutate(Position = fct_lump(Position, n = 2)) %>%
  count(Position)
```

## In-course exercise

We'll now take a break to do Section 5 of the In-course Exercise for Chapter 6. 

# Working with strings

## String operations

For these examples, we'll use some data on passengers of the Titanic. You can load this data using:

```{r}
# install.packages("titanic")
library("titanic")
data("titanic_train")
```

We will be using the `stringr` package:

```{r}
library("stringr")
```

## String operations

This data includes a column called "Name" with passenger names. This column is somewhat messy and includes several elements that we might want to separate (last name, first name, title). 

Here are the first few values of "Name": 

```{r}
titanic_train %>% select(Name) %>% slice(1:3)
```

## String operations

The `str_trim` function from the `stringr` package allows you to trim leading and trailing whitespace: 

```{r}
with_spaces <- c("    a ", "  bob", " gamma")
with_spaces
str_trim(with_spaces)
```

This is rarer, but if you ever want to, you can add leading and / or trailing whitespace to elements of a character vector with `str_pad` from the `stringr` package.

## String operations

There are also functions to change a full character string to uppercase, lowercase, or title case: 

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(titanic)
data(titanic_train)
```

```{r}
str_to_upper("Braund, Mr. Owen Harris")
str_to_lower("Braund, Mr. Owen Harris")
str_to_title("braund, mr. owen harris")
```

# Regular expressions

## Regular expressions

We've already done some things to manipulate strings. For example, if we wanted to separate "Name" into last name and first name (including title), we could actually do that with the `separate` function: 

```{r}
titanic_train %>% 
  select(Name) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  separate(Name, c("last_name", "first_name"), sep = ", ")
```

## Regular expressions

Notice that `separate` is looking for a regular pattern (", ") and then doing something based on the location of that pattern in each string (splitting the string). \bigskip

There are a variety of functions in R that can perform manipulations based on finding regular patterns in character strings.

```

```

## Regular expressions

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/regex_pattern_1.jpg")
```


## Regular expression patterns

The easiest regular expression patterns are literal text. For example, the regular expression
pattern if you're trying to match "Mr" is just "Mr": 

```{r}
ex_names <- c("Braund, Mr. Owen Harris",
              "Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley",
              "Heikkinen, Miss. Laina")
str_extract(ex_names, pattern = "Mr")
```

## Regular expression patterns

Regular expression patterns are case sensitive, so you won't match "Mr" with the
pattern "mr":

```{r}
ex_names <- c("Braund, Mr. Owen Harris",
              "Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley",
              "Heikkinen, Miss. Laina")
str_extract(ex_names, pattern = "mr")
```

## Regular expression patterns

There are a few characters called **metacharacters** that mean something special in 
regular expression patterns. 

To use any of these literally in a regular expression, you 
need to "protect" them with two backslashes. 

## Regular expressions

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/regex_pattern_2.jpg")
```

## Regular expressions

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/regex_pattern_3.jpg")
```

## Regular expression patterns

For example, "." is a metacharacter, so to match "Mr.", you need to use the pattern `"Mr\\."`:

```{r}
ex_names <- c("Braund, Mr. Owen Harris",
              "Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley",
              "Heikkinen, Miss. Laina")
str_extract(ex_names, pattern = "Mr\\.")
```

## Regular expression metacharacters

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/regexp_metachars.jpg")
```

## Regular expression patterns

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/regex_pattern_4.jpg")
```

## Regular expression patterns

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/regex_pattern_5.jpg")
```

## Regular expressions

The last pattern used `[a-z]+` to match one or more lowercase letters. The `[a-z]`is a **character class**. \bigskip 

You can also match digits (`[0-9]`), uppercase letters (`[A-Z]`), just some letters (`[aeiou]`), etc. \bigskip

You can negate a character class by starting it with `^`. For example, `[^0-9]` will match anything that **isn't** a digit. 

## Regular expression patterns

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/regex_pattern_6.jpg")
```

## Regular expressions

The `str_detect` function will look through each element of a character vector for a designated pattern. If the pattern is there, it will return `TRUE`, and otherwise `FALSE`. The convention is: 

```
## Generic code
str_detect(string = [vector you want to check], 
           pattern = [pattern you want to check for])
```

For example, to create a logical vector specifying which of the Titanic passenger names include "Mrs.", you can call:

```{r}
mrs <- str_detect(titanic_train$Name, "Mrs\\.")
head(mrs)
```


## Regular expressions

The result is a logical vector, so `str_detect` can be used in `filter` to subset data to only rows where the passenger's name includes "Mrs.":

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  filter(str_detect(Name, "Mrs\\.")) %>%
  select(Name) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

## Regular expressions

The `str_extract` function can be used to extract a string (if it exists) from each value in a character vector. It follows similar conventions to `str_detect`:

```
## Generic code
str_extract(string = [vector you want to check], 
           pattern = [pattern you want to check for])
```

## Regular expressions

For example, you might want to extract "Mrs." if it exists in a passenger's name:

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  mutate(mrs = str_extract(Name, "Mrs\\.")) %>%
  select(Name, mrs) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

Notice that now we're creating a new column (`mrs`) that either has "Mrs." (if there's a match) or is missing (`NA`) if there's not a match. 

## Regular expressions

For this first example, we were looking for an exact string ("Mrs"). However, you can use patterns that match a particular pattern, but not an exact string. For example, we could expand the regular expression to find "Mr." or "Mrs.":  

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  mutate(title = str_extract(Name, "Mr[s]*\\.")) %>%
  select(Name, title) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

This pattern uses `[s]*` to match zero or more "s"s at this spot in the pattern. 

## Regular expressions

In the previous code, we found "Mr." and "Mrs.", but missed "Miss.". We could tweak the pattern again to try to capture that, as well. For all three, we have the pattern that it starts with "M", has some lowercase letters, and then ends with ".".  

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  mutate(title = str_extract(Name, "M[a-z]+\\.")) %>%
  select(Name, title) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```



## Regular expressions 

Sometimes, you want to match a pattern, but then only subset a part of it. For example, each passenger seems to have a title ("Mr.", "Mrs.", etc.) that comes after ", " and before ". ". We can use this pattern to find the title, but then we get some extra stuff with the match: 

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  mutate(title = str_extract(Name, ", [A-Z][a-z]*\\.")) %>%
  select(title) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```


## Regular expressions 

We are getting things like ", Mr. ", when we really want "Mr". We can use the `str_match` function to do this. We group what we want to extract from the pattern in parentheses, and then the function returns a matrix. The first column is the full pattern match, and each following column gives just what matches within the groups. 

```{r}
head(str_match(titanic_train$Name,
          pattern = ", ([A-Z][a-z]*)\\."))
```

## Regular expressions 

To get just the title, then, we can run:

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  mutate(title = 
           str_match(Name, ", ([A-Z][a-z]*)\\.")[ , 2]) %>%
  select(Name, title) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

The `[ , 2]` pulls out just the second column from the matrix returned by `str_match`. 

## Regular expressions 

Here are some of the most common titles: 

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  mutate(title = 
           str_match(Name, ", ([A-Z][a-z]*)\\.")[ , 2]) %>%
  group_by(title) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% slice(1:5)
```

## Regular expressions

The following slides have a few other examples of regular expressions in action with this dataset. \bigskip

Get just names that start with ("^") the letter "A":

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  filter(str_detect(Name, "^A")) %>%
  select(Name) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

## Regular expressions

Get names with "II" or "III" (`{2,}` says to match at least two times):

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  filter(str_detect(Name, "I{2,}")) %>%
  select(Name) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

## Regular expressions

Get names with "Andersen" or "Anderson" (alternatives in square brackets):

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  filter(str_detect(Name, "Anders[eo]n")) %>%
  select(Name)
```


## Regular expressions

Get names that start with ("^" outside of brackets) the letters "A" and "B":

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  filter(str_detect(Name, "^[AB]")) %>%
  select(Name) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

## Regular expressions

Get names that end with ("$") the letter "b" (either lowercase or uppercase):

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  filter(str_detect(Name, "[bB]$")) %>%
  select(Name) 
```


## Regular expressions

There is a family of older, base R functions called `grep` that does something very similar.

You may see these functions in example code.

## Tidy select

There are [`tidyverse`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html) functions to make selecting variables more straightforwards. You can call these functions as arguments of the `select` function to streamline variable selection. Examples include: `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, and `contains()`.

## Tidy select (helpers)

Here we use `starts_with("t")` to select all variables that begin with `t`.

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  select(starts_with("t")) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

## Tidy select


The are also tidyverse functions that allow us to easily operate on a selection of variables. These functions are called [`scoped varients`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/scoped.html). You can identity these functions by these `_all`, `_at`, and `_if` suffixes.


## Tidy select (*_if)

Here we use `select_if` to select all the numeric variables in a dataframe and covert their names to lower case (a handy function to tidy the variable names).

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  select_if(is.numeric, tolower) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```

## Tidy select (*_if)

The `select_if` function takes the following form.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Generic code
new_df <- select_if(old_df,
                    .predicate [selects the variable to keep], 
                    .funs = [the function to apply to 
                             the selected column names])
```

## Tidy select (*_at)

Here we use `select_at` to select all the variables that contain `ss` in their name and then covert their names to lower case (a handy function to tidy the variable names).

```{r}
titanic_train %>%
  select_at(vars(contains("ss")), tolower) %>%
  slice(1:3)
```
