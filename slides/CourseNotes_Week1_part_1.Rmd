# What is R?

## What is R?

- A programming language good for data analysis / statistics
- A base package of some software with many available user-created add-ons (packages)
- Free and open-source software
- An interpreted language

\bigskip

R is currently popular in a number of fields, including:

- Statistics / Biostatistics
- Machine learning
- Data journalism 
- Ecology 
- Financial engineering
- Bioinformatics

## What is R?

R is a programming language popular for statistical computing. \medskip

> "The best thing about R is that it was developed by statisticians. The worst thing about R is that... it was developed by statisticians."

> -Bo Cowgill, Google, at the Bay Area R Users Group

Other programming languages popular for statistical computing include: 

- SAS
- SPSS
- Matlab
- Julia
- Python

## Free and open-source software

How a lot of software is created:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/OpenSourceOverviewIntro.png")
```

## Free and open-source software

A basic sketch of how software can be "free":

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/OpenSourceOverview.png")
```

- **Gratis**: Free as in beer
- **Libre**: Free as in speech

## Free and open-source software

With open-source software (free as in speech), you can:

- Check out the code to figure out how the software works
- Share the code (and software) with other people
- Make any changes you want to the code

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "300pt", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/OpenSourceOverview.png")
```

<!-- ## Open-source software -->

<!-- > "Open-source software is simply software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. ... Open-source systems are tried and tested. A majority of supercomputers use them. The Defense Department, NASA and the United States Air Force all use open-source systems, because they know this provides far more security. Every step in our voting process should use software that follows these examples." -->

## Free and open-source software

> "Despite its name, open-source software is less vulnerable to hacking than the secret, black box systems like those being used in polling places now. That’s because anyone can see how open-source systems operate. Bugs can be spotted and remedied, deterring those who would attempt attacks. This makes them much more secure than closed-source models like Microsoft’s, which only Microsoft employees can get into to fix."

[Woolsey and Fox. *To Protect Voting, Use Open-Source Software.* New York Times. August 3, 2017.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/opinion/open-source-software-hacker-voting.html?mcubz=3)

<!-- ## Open-source software -->

<!-- > "One reason for the software companies’ resistance is the belief that it’s impossible to make a profit from open-source software. This is a myth. Businesses that use open-source software still need all of the other things that software companies provide. Many major companies use open-source software in their products." -->

## Free and open-source software

Funding agencies are starting to ask for grant proposals to develop open-source tools. For example, a recent call from the NIH asks for: \medskip

> "**Open-source,** generalizable, and scalable bioinformatics tools"

NIH RFA-RM-17-012: "Metabolomics Data Analysis and Interpretation Tools (U01)"

## Interpreted languages

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "325pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/program_types.jpg")
```

## Interpreted languages

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "325pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/program_types2.jpg")
```

## Interpreted languages

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "325pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/program_types3.jpg")
```

## RStudio vs. R

In this class, I'm having you download both R and RStudio. It's helpful for you 
to know the difference between the two. 

**R** provides the engine, while **RStudio** provides a nice place to work 
while using that engine (the leather interior, say). 

## RStudio vs. R

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "300pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/r_vs_rstudio.jpg")
```

## RStudio vs. R

```{r fig.align = "center", out.width = "200pt", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/plain_delorean.jpg")
```

**Note:** When you open **R**, it does have a user interface, it's just not 
as nice as RStudio's.

## RStudio vs. R

RStudio (the software) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You
download it separately from R, but it's a "nicer" way to work in R.

\bigskip

This IDE includes: 

- An interface with "panes" for key tasks you'll be doing (e.g., one pane with
the R console, one for scripts, one to view graphs)
- Code highlighting
- Version control (git) and interface with GitHub
- Tools for Shiny web app development
- Tools for R package development

## RStudio vs. R

RStudio (the company) is a leader in the R community. Currently, the company:

- Develops and freely provides the RStudio IDE
- Provides excellent resources for learning and using R (e.g., cheatsheets, free
online books)
- Is producing some of the most-used R packages 
- Employs some of the top people in R development
- Is a key member of The R Consortium (others include Microsoft, IBM, and Google)

## Setting up

If do not already have them, you will need to download and install both R and RStudio. 

- Go to https://cran.r-project.org and download the latest version of R for your system. Install.
- Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and download the latest version of RStudio Desktop for your system. Install. 
- Defaults should be fine for everything.
