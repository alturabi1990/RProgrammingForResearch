# Organizing larger R Projects

## Organization

So far, you have run much of your analysis within a single R script or R Markdown file. Often, any associated data are within the same working directory as your script or R Markdown file, but the files for one project are not separated from files for other projects. \bigskip

As you move to larger projects, this kind of set-up won't work as well. Instead, you'll want to start keeping all materials for a project in a single and exclusive directory.

## Organization

Often, it helps to organize the files in a project directory into subdirectories. Common subdirectories include: 

- `data-raw`: Raw data and R scripts to clean the raw data. 
- `data`: Cleaned data, often saved as `.RData` after being generated by a script in `data-raw`.
- `R`: Code for any functions used in analysis.
- `reports`: Any final products rendered from R Markdown and their original R Markdown files (e.g., paper drafts, reports, presentations).

## R Projects

RStudio allows you to create "Projects" to organize code, data, and results within a directory. When you create a project, RStudio adds a file with the extension ".Rproj" to the directory. \bigskip

Advantages of setting a directory to be an R Project are: 

- Automatically uses the directory as your current working directory when you open the project. 
- Coordinates well with git version control and GitHub repository system. 
- Opens a "Files" window for navigating project files in an RStudio pane when you open the project. 

## R Projects

You can create a new project from scratch or from an existing directory. \bigskip

To create an R project from a working directory, in RStudio go to "File" -> "New Project" -> "New Directory". You can then choose where you want to save the new project directory.
