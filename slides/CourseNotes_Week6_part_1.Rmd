# Tidy data

## Tidy data

All of the material in this section comes directly from Hadley Wickham's [paper
on tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). You will need to read
this paper to prepare for the quiz on this section.

## Characteristics of tidy data

Characteristics of tidy data are:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Getting your data into a "tidy" format makes it easier to model and plot. By
taking the time to tidy your data at the start of an analysis, you will save
yourself time, and make it easier to plan out, later steps.

## Five common problems

Here are five common problems that Hadley Wickham has identified that keep data
from being tidy:

1. Column headers are values, not variable names.
2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.
3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

In the following slides, I'll give examples of each of these problems.

## Five common problems

(1.) Column headers are values, not variable names.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataProblem1.png")
```

## Five common problems

Solution: 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.6\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataSolution1.png")
```

## Five common problems

(2.) Multiple variables are stored in one column.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.4\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataProblem2.png")
```

## Five common problems

Solution: 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.4\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataSolution2.png")
```

## Five common problems

(3.) Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataProblem3.png")
```

## Five common problems

Solution: 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataSolution3.png")
```

## Five common problems

(4.) Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataProblem4.png")
```

## Five common problems

Solution: 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth"}
include_graphics("../figures/TidyDataSolution4.png")
```

## Five common problems

(5.) A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. \bigskip

Example: exposure and outcome data stored in different files: 

- File 1: Daily mortality counts
- File 2: Daily air pollution measurements
