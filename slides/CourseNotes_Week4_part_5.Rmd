# Make order meaningful

## Order

Guideline 4: **Make order meaningful.** \bigskip

You can make the ranking of data clearer from a graph by using order to show rank. Often, factor or categorical variables are ordered by something that is not interesting, like alphabetical order. 

## Order

Guideline 4: **Make order meaningful.** \bigskip

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, message = FALSE}
ex <- group_by(worldcup, Team) %>%
        summarise(mean_time = mean(Time))

a <- ggplot(ex, aes(x = mean_time, y = Team)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        theme_few() + 
        xlab("Mean time per player (minutes)") + ylab("") + 
        ggtitle("1. Alphabetical order")

ex2 <- arrange(ex, mean_time) %>%
        mutate(Team = factor(Team, levels = Team))
b <- ggplot(ex2, aes(x = mean_time, y = Team)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        theme_few() + 
        xlab("Mean time per player (minutes)") +  ylab("") + 
        ggtitle("2. Meaningful order")

grid.arrange(a, b, ncol = 2)
```

## Order

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.7\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/alphabetical_rainbow.png")
```


## Order

You can re-order factor variables in a graph by resetting the factor using several 
functions from the `forcats` package. 

The simplest is `fct_relevel`, which lets you change the levels "by hand". 

See the "factors" cheatsheet for more `forcats` functions.

## Changing factor levels

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/relevel_factor.jpg")
```
