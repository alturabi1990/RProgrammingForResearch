# Reproducible research

## What is reproducible research?

**Reproducible**: Could someone else re-do your entire analysis?

- Data available
- All code for cleaning raw data
- All code and software (specific versions, packages) for analysis

The *Methods* section of the future...

## Why is it important?

Some advantages of making your research reproducible are:

- You can (easily) figure out what you did six months from now.
- You can (easily) make adjustments to code or data, even early in the process, and re-run all analysis.
- When you're ready to publish, you can (easily) do a last double-check of your full analysis, from cleaning the raw data through generating figures and tables for the paper.
- You can pass along or share a project with others.
- You can give useful code examples to people who want to extend your research.

## Why is it important?

An example of how reproducibility can help check scientific results (Source: The New York Times---link below): \bigskip 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/NYTimes.png")
```

## Some steps to making research reproducible

- All your raw data should be saved in the project directory. You should have clear documentation on the source of all this data.
- Scripts should be included with all the code used to clean this data into the data set(s) used for final analyses and to create any figures and tables.
- You should include details on the versions of any software used in analysis (for R, this includes the version of R as well as versions of all packages used). 
- If possible, there so be no "by hand" steps used in the analysis; instead, all steps should be done using code saved in scripts. For example, you should use a script to clean data, rather than cleaning it by hand in Excel. If any "non-scriptable" steps are unavoidable, you should very clearly document those steps. 

## Tools for research reproducible

There are several software tools that can help you improve the reproducibility of your research: 

- **`knitr`**: Create files that include both your code and text. These can be compiled to create final reports and papers. They keep code within the final file for the report.
- **`knitr` complements**: Create fancier tables and figures within RMarkdown documents. Packages include `tikzDevice`, `animate`, `xtables`, `pander`, and `kableExtra`.
- **`packrat`** and **renv**: Save versions of each package used for the analysis, then load those package versions when code is run again in the future.

Today we will focus on using `knitr` and RMarkdown files.
