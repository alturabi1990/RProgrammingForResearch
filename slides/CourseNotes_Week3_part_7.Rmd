# Tidyverse and cheatsheets

## The "tidyverse"

So far, we have used a number of packages that are part of the *tidyverse*. The
tidyverse is a collection of recent and developing packages for R, many written
by Hadley Wickham. \medskip

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.6\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/tidyverse_hexbin.jpeg")
```

## The "tidyverse"

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.7\\textwidth", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/HadleyObama.png")
```

## Cheatsheets

RStudio has several very helpful **cheatsheets**. These are one-page sheets
(front and back) that cover many of the main functions for a certain topic or
task in R. These cheatsheets cover a lot of the main "tidyverse" functions.

You can access these directly from RStudio. Go to "Help" -> "Cheatsheets" and
select the cheatsheet on the topic of interest.

You can find even more of these cheatsheets at
https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/.

## Cheatsheets

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/rstudio_cheatsheet.png")
```

## More reading / practice

If you would like more reading and practice on what we've covered so far on transforming data, see chapter 5 of the "R for Data Science" book suggested at the start of the course.
