# Directory structure

## Computer directory structure

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "275pt"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/FileDirectoryStructure.png")
```

## Working directory

The **working directory** is the directory within your directory structure from which your R session is currently working. 

When you use **R Projects** to organize your work and files in R, anytime you open one of your R Projects, your working directory will automatically be that project's directory. 

## Working directory

To confirm this, open one of your R Projects and print out your working directory using the function `getwd()`: 

\small

```{r eval = FALSE}
getwd()
```

```
[1] "/Users/brookeanderson/Desktop/RCourseFall2015"
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "200pt"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/FileDirectoryStructure.png")
```

## Working directory

You can use the `list.files()` function to list all the files in your current working directory:

\small

```{r eval = FALSE}
list.files()
```

```
[1] "CourseText"    "Week1_Aug24"     "Week2_Aug31"
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "200pt"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/FileDirectoryStructure.png")
```


## Working directory

The "Files" pane in RStudio (often on the lower right) will also show you the files available in your current working directory. 

This should line up with what you get if you run `list.files()`.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "250pt"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/RStudioFilePane.png")
```

## Working directory

When you run `list.files()`, if there is a name without a file extension, it's probably the name of a **subdirectory** of your current working directory. 
To list the files in one of these subdirectories, you can use `list.files` with that subdirectory's name. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list.files(path = "CourseText")
```
```
[1]  "temperature.csv"      "heat_mort.csv"
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "150pt"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/FileDirectoryStructure.png")
```
