# Other R objects: Matrices and lists

## Matrices

A matrix is like a data frame, but all the values in all columns must be of the same class (e.g., numeric, character). (Another way you can think of it is as a "wrapped" vector.)

Matrices can be faster and more memory-efficient than data frames. Also, a lot of statistical
methods within R code is implemented using linear algebra and other mathematical 
techniques based on matrices.

## Matrices

We can use the `matrix()` function to construct a matrix:

```{r}
foo <- matrix(1:10, ncol = 5)
foo
```

## Matrices

The `as.matrix()` function is used to convert an object to a matrix:

```{r}
foo <- data.frame(col_1 = 1:2, col_2 = 3:4,
                  col_3 = 5:6, col_4 = 7:8,
                  col_5 = 9:10)
foo <- as.matrix(foo)
foo
```

## Matrices

You can index matrices with square brackets, just like data frames: 

```{r}
foo[1, 1:2]
```

You cannot, however, use `dplyr` functions with matrices: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foo %>% filter(col_1 == 1)
```
```
Error in UseMethod("filter_") : 
  no applicable method for 'filter_' applied to an object of 
  class "c('matrix', 'integer', 'numeric')"
```

# Lists

## Lists

Lists are the "kitchen sink" of R objects. They can be used to keep together a variety of different R objects of different classes, dimensions, and structures in a single R object. 

Because there are often cases where an R operation results in output that doesn't have a simple structure, lists can be a very useful way to output complex output from an R function. 

Most lists are not "tidy" data. However, we'll cover some ways that you can easily "tidy" some common list objects you might use a lot in your R code, including the output of fitting linear and generalized linear models.

## Lists

```{r}
example_list <- list(a = sample(1:10, 5), 
                     b = tibble(letters = letters[1:3], 
                                numbers = 1:3))
example_list
```

## Indexing lists

To pull an element out of a list, you can either use `$` or `[[]]` indexing:

```{r}
example_list$a
```

```{r}
example_list[[2]]
```

## Indexing lists


To access a specific value within a list element we can index the element using double, double brackets:

```{r}
example_list[["b"]][["numbers"]]
```

Again, we can index using names or numeric indices:

```{r}
example_list[["b"]][[1]]
```

## Exploring lists

If an R object is a list, running `class` on the object will return "list": 

```{r}
class(example_list)
```

Often, lists will have names for each element (similar to column names for a dataframe). You can get the names of all elements of a list using the `names` function: 

```{r}
names(example_list)
```

## Exploring lists

The `str` function is also useful for exploring the structure of a list object: 

\footnotesize

```{r}
str(example_list)
```

## Exploring lists

A list can even contain other lists. We can use the `str` function to see the structure of a list:

```{r cakk}
a_list <- list(list("a", "b"), list(1, 2))

str(a_list)
```

## Exploring lists

Using `str` to print out the list's structure doesn't produce the easiest to digest output. We can use the `jsonedit` function from the `listviewer` package to create a widget in the Viewer pane to more esily explore our list.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(listviewer)
jsonedit(a_list)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.7\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("../figures/listviewer_pane.png")
```

<!-- ## Exploring lists -->

<!-- Sometimes you'll see unnecessary lists-of-lists, perhaps when importing data into R created. Or a list with multiple elements that you would like to combine.  -->

<!-- \footnotesize -->

<!-- ```{r cakl, warning = FALSE} -->
<!-- library(purrr) -->
<!-- a_list -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Exploring lists -->

<!-- You can remove a level of hierarchy from a list using the `flatten` function from the `purrr` package: -->

<!-- \footnotesize -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- flatten(a_list) -->
<!-- ``` -->


## Lists versus dataframes

As a note, a dataframe is actually just a very special type of list. It is a list where every element (column in the dataframe) is a vector of the same length, and the object has a special attribute specifying that it is a dataframe. 

```{r}
example_df <- tibble(letters = letters[1:3], 
                     number = 1:3)
class(example_df)
is.list(example_df)
```
