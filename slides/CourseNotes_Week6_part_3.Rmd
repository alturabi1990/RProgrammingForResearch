# Longer and wider data

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

There are two functions from the `tidyr` package (another member of the
tidyverse) that you can use to change between wide and long data: `pivot_longer`
and `pivot_wider`. \bigskip

These are brand new, and they replace the older `gather` and `spread` functions. 
To use the new functions, you many need to install the development version
of the `tidyr` package. You can do that with: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

Here is a description of these two functions:

- `pivot_longer`: Takes several columns and pivots them down into two columns. One of the new columns contains the former column names and the other contains the former cell values.
- `pivot_wider`: Takes two columns and pivots them up into multiple columns. Column names for the new columns will come from one column and the cell values from the other.

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

```{r out.width = "\\textwidth", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/pivot_functions.jpg")
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

The following examples show the effects of making a dataset longer or wider.
\bigskip

Here is some example wide data:

```{r, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
hogwarts_wide <- tibble(
  student = c("Harry", "Hermione"),
  math = c(89, 100),
  english = c(92, 99), 
  science = c(93, 98)
)
```

```{r}
hogwarts_wide
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

In the `hogwarts_wide` dataset, there are separate columns for three different
courses (`math`, `english`, and `science`). Each cell gives the value for a
certain stock on a certain day. 


```{r}
hogwarts_wide
```

This data isn't "tidy", because the identify of the course (`math`, `english`,
or `science`) is a variable, and you'll probably want to include it as a
variable in modeling.

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

If you want to convert the dataframe to have all stock values in a single column, you can use `pivot_longer` to convert wide data to long data: 

```{r}
library("tidyr")
hogwarts_long <- pivot_longer(data = hogwarts_wide,
                              cols = math:science,
                              names_to = "subject",
                              values_to = "grade")
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

In this "longer" dataframe, there is now one column that gives the identify of
the course (`subject`) and another column that gives the grade a student got 
for that course (`grade`):

```{r}
hogwarts_long
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

The format for a `pivots_longer` call is: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Generic code
new_df <- pivot_longer(old_df,
                       cols = [name(s) of the columns you want 
                               to make longer],
                       names_to = [name of new column to store 
                                   the old column names],
                       values_to = [name of new column to store 
                                    the old values])
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

Three important notes:

- Everything is pivoted into one of two columns---one column with the old
column names, and one column with the old cell values
- With the `names_to` and `values_to` arguments, you are just providing column
names for the two columns that everything's pivoted into. When you are pivoting
from "wide" to "long", you get to pick these names.
- If there is a column you don't want to include in the pivot (`date` in the
example), use `-` to exclude it in the `cols` argument.

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

Notice how easy it is, now that the data is gathered, to use `subject` for
aesthetics of faceting in a `ggplot2` call:

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(hogwarts_long, aes(x = student, y = grade)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~ subject) +
  theme_bw()
```

## `pivot_longer` / `pivot_wider`

If you have data in a "longer" format and would like to make it "wider", you can
use `pivot_wider` to do that:

```{r}
hogwarts <- pivot_wider(hogwarts_long, 
                        names_from = "subject", 
                        values_from = "grade")
```

Notice that this reverses the action of `pivot_longer`.

## Further reading

Chapters 12 and 13 of "R for Data Science" are an excellent supplemental
resource if you'd like extra practice on tidy data, pivoting, and joining
different datasets.

**Note:** At this time "R for Data Science" uses the `gather` and `spread`
instead of `pivot_*`. These are older functions, you should use `pivot_*`.
