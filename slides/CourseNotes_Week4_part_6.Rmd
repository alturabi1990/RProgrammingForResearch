# Small multiples

## Small multiples

Guideline 5: **When possible, use small multiples.** \bigskip

*Small multiples* are graphs that use many small plots showing the same thing for different facets of the data. For example, instead of using color in a single plot to show data for males and females, you could use two small plots, one each for males and females. \bigskip

Typically, in small multiples, all plots with use the same x- and y-axes. This makes it easier to compare across plots, and it also allows you to save room by limiting axis annotation.

------

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
ex <- subset(worldcup, Position %in% c("Forward",
                                       "Midfielder"))
ex2 <- group_by(ex, Team) %>%
        summarise(mean = mean(Shots)) %>%
        arrange(desc(mean))
ex$Team <- factor(ex$Team, 
                      levels = ex2$Team)
a <- ggplot(ex, aes(x = Time, y = Shots)) + 
        geom_point() + 
        theme_few() + 
        facet_wrap(~ Team, ncol = 8) 
a
```

## Small multiples

You can use the `facet` functions to create small multiples. This separates the graph into several small graphs, one for each level of a factor. \bigskip

The `facet` functions are: 

- `facet_grid()`
- `facet_wrap()`


## Small multiples

The `facet_grid` function can facet by one or two variables. One will be shown by rows, and one by columns:

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Generic code
facet_grid([factor for rows] ~ [factor for columns])
```

The `facet_wrap()` function can only facet by one variable, but it can "wrap" the small graphs for that variable, so the don't all have to be in one row or column:

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Generic code
facet_wrap(~ [factor for faceting], ncol = [# of columns])
```

## Small multiples

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.8\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/facet_grid.jpg")
```

## Small multiples

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "0.9\\textwidth", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/facet_wrap.jpg")
```

## Small multiples

For example, to create small multiples of ozone concentration by day of week for the Chicago data, you can run:

\footnotesize

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, out.width = "0.95\\textwidth"}
chic %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = o3)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "skyblue1", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ dow)
```

## Small multiples

To change the order of the facets, change the order of the factor levels for the factor you're using to facet. 

## Small multiples

For example, to move weekend days together, you could run:

\footnotesize

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, out.width = "0.95\\textwidth"}
library(forcats)
chic %>% 
  mutate(dow = fct_relevel(dow, "Saturday")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = o3)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "skyblue1", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ dow)
```
