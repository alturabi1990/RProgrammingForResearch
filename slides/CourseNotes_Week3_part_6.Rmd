# Logical operators, vectors, and expressions

## Logical operators, vectors, and expressions

**Logical operators** are operators that conduct a logical test based on 
one or more vectors, while logical expressions are the full R expressions 
that use these operators to conduct the test. The output is a **logical vector**. 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="4.5in"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/logical_expression.jpg")
```

## Logical expressions

Last week, you learned some about logical expressions and how to use them with
the `filter` function. \medskip

You can use *logical vectors*, created with these expressions, for a lot data
exploration tasks. We'll review them and add some more details this week.

## Logical vectors

A logical expression outputs a *logical vector*. This logical vector will be the
same length as the original vector tested by the logical statement:

```{r}
length(beijing_pm$value)
length(beijing_pm$value > 500)
```

## Logical vectors

Each element of the logical vector can only have one of three values (`TRUE`,
`FALSE`, `NA`). The logical vector will have the value `TRUE` at any position
where the original vector met the logical condition you tested, and `FALSE`
anywhere else:

```{r}
head(beijing_pm$value)
head(beijing_pm$value > 500)
```

## Logical vectors

Because the logical vector is the same length as the vector it's testing, you
can add logical vectors to dataframes with `mutate`:

```{r}
beijing_pm <- beijing_pm %>% 
  mutate(beyond_index = value > 500)
```

## Logical vectors

```{r}
beijing_pm %>% 
  select(sample_time, value, beyond_index)
```

## Logical vectors

As another example, you could add a column that is a logical vector of whether
a day was in the "heating season", which usually ends on March 15 each year:

```{r}
beijing_pm <- beijing_pm %>% 
  mutate(heating = sample_time < ymd("2017-03-15")) 
```

## Common logical and relational operators in R

The **bang operator** (`!`) negates (flips) a logical expression:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3) == c(1, 2, 5)
!(c(1, 2, 3) == c(1, 2, 5))
```

```{r}
is.na(c(1, 2,  NA))
!is.na(c(1, 2, NA))
```

## Common logical and relational operators in R

The `%in%` operator will check each element of a 
vector to see if it's a value that is included in a second 
vector. 

In this case, the two vectors don't have to have 
the same length: 

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3) %in% c(1, 5)
```

This logical expressions is asking *Is the first element of the first vector, 1,
in the set given by the second vector, 1 and 5? Is the second element of the
first vector, 2, in the set given by the second vector? Etc.*

## Logical vectors

You can do a few cool things now with this vector. For example, you can use it
with the `filter` function to pull out just the rows where `heating` is `TRUE`:

```{r}
beijing_pm %>% 
  filter(heating) %>% 
  slice(1:3)
```

## Logical vectors

Or, with `!`, just the rows where `heating` is `FALSE`:

```{r}
beijing_pm %>% 
  filter(!heating) %>% 
  slice(1:3)
```

## Logical vectors

All of the values in a logical vector are saved, at a deeper level, with a
number. Values of `TRUE` are saved as 1 and values of `FALSE` are saved as 0.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="4.5in"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/how_r_saves_logical_vector.jpg")
```

## Logical vectors

```{r}
head(beijing_pm$beyond_index)
```

```{r}
head(as.numeric(beijing_pm$beyond_index))
```


## Logical vectors

Therefore, you can use `sum()` to get the sum of all values in a vector. Because
logical vector values are linked with numerical values of 0 or 1, you can use
`sum()` to find out how many males and females are in the dataset:

```{r}
sum(beijing_pm$beyond_index)
sum(!beijing_pm$beyond_index)
```
